# MCGI FRONT
 This is a fully responsive web application for Members Church Of God International, leveraging React.js for the front-end and Node.js for the back end. Robust authentication and authorization were implemented using OAuth. The application features a user-friendly interface designed to facilitate key functions such as membership management, event registration, and online giving. For content management and database storage, I integrate Google Suite (Docs, Sheets). CORS was utilized to handle cross-origin requests, ensuring secure communication between the front end and back end
